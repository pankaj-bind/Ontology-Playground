# Ontology Authoring Guide

How to create an ontology that works well in Ontology Playground — from the
graph visualization and inspector to the natural-language query playground and
embeddable widget.

---

## Quick checklist

Before you submit, make sure your ontology has:

- [ ] A clear, human-readable **name** (e.g., "Healthcare System", not "hc_v2")
- [ ] A **description** that explains the domain in one sentence
- [ ] **3–8 entity types**, each with a name, description, icon, and color
- [ ] **At least one identifier property** per entity (marked `isIdentifier`)
- [ ] **Relationships** with verb-based names and cardinalities
- [ ] A **metadata.json** with name, description, category, and tags

## 1. Ontology structure

An ontology in this project has four parts:

```
Ontology
├── name            "Cosmic Coffee Company"
├── description     "A coffee shop chain with suppliers, products, stores…"
├── entityTypes[]   The concepts in your domain
└── relationships[] How those concepts connect
```

### Entity types

Each entity type represents a real-world concept. Think of it as a table in a
database or a class in a UML diagram.

```
EntityType
├── id              "customer"          (URL-safe slug, unique within the ontology)
├── name            "Customer"          (human-readable, singular noun)
├── description     "A person who purchases coffee products"
├── icon            "👤"               (emoji)
├── color           "#0078D4"           (hex color for the graph node)
└── properties[]
    ├── { name: "customerId", type: "string", isIdentifier: true }
    ├── { name: "name",       type: "string" }
    ├── { name: "email",      type: "string" }
    └── { name: "loyaltyTier", type: "enum", values: ["Bronze","Silver","Gold"] }
```

### Relationships

Each relationship is a directional link between two entity types.

```
Relationship
├── id              "places"            (URL-safe slug, unique)
├── name            "places"            (a verb — "places", "contains", "teaches")
├── from            "customer"          (source entity ID)
├── to              "order"             (target entity ID)
├── cardinality     "one-to-many"       (one-to-one | one-to-many | many-to-one | many-to-many)
├── description     "A customer places one or more orders"
└── attributes[]    (optional — properties on the relationship itself)
    └── { name: "quantity", type: "integer" }
```

## 2. Field-by-field guide

Every field in the ontology is used somewhere in the app. Here's exactly
where, and what makes a good value.

### Entity fields

| Field | Used in | Best practice |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `id` | Internal graph IDs, URL routing, query engine matching | Lowercase slug, no spaces: `customer`, `work-order` |
| `name` | Graph node labels, inspector, query suggestions, search | **Singular noun**, title case: "Customer", "Work Order" |
| `description` | Inspector panel, query results, embed inspector | One sentence explaining the concept. Starts with an article: "A person who…" |
| `icon` | Graph node labels, inspector header, query results | Single emoji that represents the concept: 👤 🛒 🏥 🏭 |
| `color` | Graph node background, inspector accent | Hex color. Use the Microsoft palette for consistency (see below) |
| `properties` | Inspector details, query suggestions, RDF output | 3–8 properties per entity. Mix types for interesting queries |

### Property fields

| Field | Used in | Best practice |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `name` | Inspector property list, query suggestions, RDF output | camelCase, descriptive: `loyaltyTier`, not `lt` or `field3` |
| `type` | Inspector type badges, RDF XSD mapping | One of: `string`, `integer`, `decimal`, `date`, `datetime`, `boolean`, `enum` |
| `isIdentifier` | 🔑 badge in inspector, validation, RDF output | Exactly **one** property per entity must be the identifier |
| `description` | Inspector (if present) | Optional. Useful for non-obvious properties |
| `unit` | Inspector (if present) | Optional. E.g., `"USD"`, `"kg"`, `"minutes"` |
| `values` | Inspector enum display | Required when `type` is `enum`. Array of allowed values |

### Relationship fields

| Field | Used in | Best practice |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `id` | Internal edge IDs, query engine matching | Lowercase slug: `places`, `sourced-from` |
| `name` | Graph edge labels, query results, inspector | **Active verb** describing the direction: "places", "teaches", "monitors" |
| `from` / `to` | Graph edge source/target | Must match existing entity `id` values |
| `cardinality` | Inspector, query results, RDF output | Think about real-world multiplicity. A customer places *many* orders → `one-to-many` |
| `description` | Inspector panel | One sentence: "A customer places one or more orders" |
| `attributes` | Inspector, RDF output | Optional. Use for properties that belong to the *relationship*, not the entities (e.g., `quantity` on an order→product link) |

## 3. How the query playground uses your ontology

The natural-language query playground generates suggestions and processes
queries based on your ontology's fields. Understanding this helps you write
ontologies that produce good query experiences.

### Auto-generated suggestions

The app creates up to 6 sample queries from your ontology:

| Pattern | Source | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| "Show me all **Xs**" | First entity's `name` (pluralized) | "Show me all customers" |
| "List all **Ys**" | Second entity's `name` | "List all orders" |
| "Show **X**s by **prop**" | Non-identifier string properties | "Show customers by loyaltyTier" |
| "How does **X** connect to **Y**?" | First relationship's `from`/`to` entities | "How does Customer connect to Order?" |

**Tip:** If your entity names are clean nouns and your properties have
descriptive names, the auto-suggestions will read naturally. If your entity
is named "tbl_cust", the suggestion becomes "Show me all tbl_custs" — not great.

### Query matching

When a user types a query, the engine matches against:

- **Entity names** — "show me all **customers**" → highlights the Customer entity
- **Property names** — "show customers by **loyaltyTier**" → highlights Customer
- **Relationship verbs** — "how does Customer **connect** to Order?" → highlights the relationship
- **Count queries** — "how many **orders**" → shows entity count
- **Conceptual queries** — "what is an entity type?" → works with any ontology

The better your names and descriptions, the richer the query results.

### What shows up in query results

When a user queries an entity, they see:

```
**Customer** 👤
A person who purchases coffee products from our stores

**Properties:**
• customerId (string) 🔑
• name (string)
• email (string)
• loyaltyTier (enum)
```

This is assembled from `entity.name`, `entity.icon`, `entity.description`, and
`entity.properties`. If any of these are empty, the result looks incomplete.

## 4. How the graph visualization uses your ontology

### Node appearance

Each entity becomes a circular node in the Cytoscape graph:

- **Label** = `icon` + `name` (e.g., "👤 Customer")
- **Background color** = `color`
- **Size** = uniform (60px), enlarged when selected

Use **distinct colors** so entities are easy to tell apart at a glance. The
official ontologies use this Microsoft-friendly palette:

| Color | Hex | Typical use |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Blue | `#0078D4` | Primary entity (Customer, Patient) |
| Green | `#107C10` | Secondary entity (Product, Provider) |
| Orange | `#D83B01` | Action entity (Order, Appointment) |
| Purple | `#5C2D91` | Supporting entity (Store, Department) |
| Teal | `#008272` | Infrastructure (Machine, Sensor) |
| Cyan | `#00A9E0` | Financial (Account, Loan) |
| Yellow | `#FFB900` | Warning/special (QualityCheck) |
| Red | `#E81123` | Critical (Diagnosis, Prescription) |

### Edge appearance

Each relationship becomes a directed edge:

- **Label** = `name` (e.g., "places")
- **Arrow** points from `from` → `to`

**Tip:** Keep relationship names short (1–2 words). Long names overlap on the
graph. "sourcedFrom" is better than "is sourced from supplier".

### Layout

The graph uses the `fcose` force-directed layout. It works best with:

- **5–8 entities** — fewer looks sparse, more gets crowded
- **Connected graphs** — every entity should have at least one relationship
- **Reasonable density** — 1–2 relationships per entity on average

## 5. How the embed widget uses your ontology

The embeddable widget renders the same graph and inspector in a standalone
container. Everything mentioned above applies, plus:

- **RDF Source tab** — the widget shows your ontology as RDF/XML. Clean
  names produce readable RDF
- **Compact inspector** — the bottom overlay has limited space, so keep
  descriptions concise (one sentence, not a paragraph)
- **No search/filter** — the embed doesn't have the search bar, so users
  rely on clicking nodes. Make sure entity icons and colors are distinct

---

## 6. Metadata.json for the catalogue

Every catalogue ontology needs a `metadata.json` alongside the `.rdf` file:

```json
{
  "name": "Cosmic Coffee Company",
  "description": "A sample ontology representing a coffee shop chain with suppliers, products, stores, customers, and orders.",
  "icon": "☕",
  "category": "retail",
  "tags": ["coffee", "supply-chain", "fabric-iq"],
  "author": "your-github-username"
}
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | Yes | Same as the ontology's `name` field |
| `description` | Yes | Short description for the gallery card |
| `category` | Yes | One of: `retail`, `healthcare`, `finance`, `manufacturing`, `education`, `general`, `fibo` |
| `icon` | No | Emoji for the gallery card. Defaults to a generic icon |
| `tags` | No | Array of strings for filtering. Keep them lowercase |
| `author` | No | Your GitHub username. Shown in the gallery |

---

## 7. Common mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| No identifier property | Validation fails, Fabric IQ can't resolve entities | Add `isIdentifier: true` to one property per entity |
| Generic entity names ("Item", "Thing") | Poor query suggestions and search results | Use domain-specific nouns ("Product", "Prescription") |
| Missing descriptions | Inspector and query results show blanks | Add a one-sentence description to every entity |
| Duplicate IDs | Build script rejects the ontology | Use unique slugs: `customer`, `order`, not `entity1`, `entity2` |
| No relationships | Graph shows disconnected nodes, no interesting queries | Add at least one relationship between entities |
| Noun-based relationship names ("ownership") | Reads oddly as a graph edge label | Use verbs: "owns", "places", "teaches" |
| Too many entities (>10) | Graph layout gets cluttered | Focus on 5–8 core concepts; split larger domains |
| Same color for all entities | Can't tell nodes apart in the graph | Assign distinct colors from the palette above |

## 8. Walkthrough: creating an ontology from scratch

Let's model a **Library System** step by step.

### Step 1: Identify your entities

Think about the core concepts in the domain:
- **Book** — a title in the catalogue
- **Author** — someone who writes books
- **Member** — a library patron
- **Loan** — a book checked out by a member
- **Branch** — a physical library location

### Step 2: Define properties

For each entity, list its attributes:

| Entity | Properties |
|--------|-----------|
| Book | `isbn` (string, 🔑), `title` (string), `genre` (enum), `pageCount` (integer), `publishedDate` (date) |
| Author | `authorId` (string, 🔑), `name` (string), `nationality` (string) |
| Member | `memberId` (string, 🔑), `name` (string), `email` (string), `memberSince` (date) |
| Loan | `loanId` (string, 🔑), `loanDate` (date), `dueDate` (date), `returned` (boolean) |
| Branch | `branchId` (string, 🔑), `name` (string), `city` (string), `capacity` (integer) |

### Step 3: Define relationships

How do these concepts connect?

| Relationship | From → To | Cardinality | Why |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| `writtenBy` | Book → Author | many-to-one | Each book has one primary author |
| `borrows` | Member → Loan | one-to-many | A member can have many loans |
| `loanOf` | Loan → Book | many-to-one | Each loan is for one book |
| `locatedAt` | Book → Branch | many-to-one | A book copy belongs to a branch |
| `registeredAt` | Member → Branch | many-to-one | Members register at a branch |

### Step 4: Pick icons and colors

| Entity | Icon | Color |
|--------|------|-------|
| Book | 📚 | `#0078D4` |
| Author | ✍️ | `#5C2D91` |
| Member | 👤 | `#107C10` |
| Loan | 📋 | `#D83B01` |
| Branch | 🏛️ | `#008272` |

### Step 5: Create in the designer or write RDF

**Option A:** Open the Ontology Designer (`/#/designer`), add the entities and
relationships visually, then export as RDF.

**Option B:** Write the RDF directly following the pattern in any official
ontology (e.g., `catalogue/official/cosmic-coffee/cosmic-coffee.rdf`).

### Step 6: Test the experience

1. Load your ontology in the app (import or designer)
2. Try the query playground: "Show me all books", "How does Member connect to
   Loan?"
3. Check the inspector: click each node and edge
4. Switch to RDF Source tab: does it look clean?
5. Run validation: `npm run validate -- path/to/your-ontology.rdf`

### Step 7: Submit

Follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit
your ontology to the community catalogue via pull request.

## 9. Reference: property types

| Type | RDF XSD mapping | Example values |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| `string` | `xsd:string` | "Alice", "ORD-001" |
| `integer` | `xsd:integer` | 42, 0, -1 |
| `decimal` | `xsd:decimal` | 3.14, 99.99 |
| `date` | `xsd:date` | "2025-01-15" |
| `datetime` | `xsd:dateTime` | "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z" |
| `boolean` | `xsd:boolean` | true, false |
| `enum` | `xsd:string` (with `ont:values`) | "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold" |

---

## 10. Reference: cardinalities

| Cardinality | Meaning | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `one-to-one` | Each A maps to exactly one B, and vice versa | Employee ↔ EmployeeBadge |
| `one-to-many` | Each A maps to many Bs | Customer → Orders |
| `many-to-one` | Many As map to one B | Orders → Store |
| `many-to-many` | Many As ↔ Many Bs (often needs a junction entity) | Students ↔ Courses (via Enrollment) |
